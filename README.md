## Glorious Purpose

To whom it may concern,

People think it's hard to make a difference, but that's not true at all. 

Every one of our decisions, actions, and purchases echoes acrross our nearly 8 billion strong existence. Every bit of plastic, every ounce of kindness, all of it stretches across us all where it proliferates. It's not our rare aspects that change the world, but our common ones.  Everyone's commonalities are stacked atop each other.

So although making a difference isn't hard, making the right one is. Right now  we are still just a hedonistic litle superorganism. A colony still in its infancy, just barely able to to communicate with itself. 
We are obscured from ourselves, and that is what I want to change. Just as all people must know themselves, one day in an advanced version of ourselves, we will know each other.  

This is my silly ambition and glorious purpose. My small part will be that of the ambassador, a go between from people to person, to show the individuals the glory of the whole and the whole the fragility of the one. 

And this is where I'll attempt it. 

Kindest Regards
